usfp_indian_postremoval.1.d: "A millenarian spiritual movement known as the Ghost Dance has swept across the Indian tribes of the west, promising a return of the buffalo and the wiping away of White settlers. While the movement promotes peaceful behavior from its adherents, the sometimes wild and ecstatic dance rituals have provoked terror in White settlers, who claim the Indians are preparing themselves for apocalyptic war upon their homesteads."
usfp_indian_postremoval.1.f: ""They told the people they could dance a new world into being. There would be landslides, earthquakes, and big winds. Hills would pile up on each other. The earth would roll up like a carpet with all the white man's ugly things - the stinking new animals, sheep and pigs, the fences, the telegraph poles, the mines and factories. Underneath would be the wonderful old-new world as it had been before the white fat-takers came. The white men will be rolled up, disappear, go back to their own continent."" #Lame Deer

Those who tried to escape were run down by cavalry and slaughtered."
usfp_indian_postremoval.2.f: ""I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch as plain as when I saw them with eyes still young. And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud, and was buried in the blizzard. A people's dream died there. It was a beautiful dream. The nation's hoop is broken and scattered.

usfp_indian_postremoval.3.d: "The overturning of the world prophesied by the Ghost Dance has not come to pass. While the initial enthusiasm for the movement has waned, its influence has forged cross-cultural links across Indian nations, fostering a pan-Indian sense of identity that stands in opposition to our program of assimilation."
usfp_indian_postremoval.3.f: ""When the Sun died, I went up to Heaven and saw God and all the people who had died a long time ago. God told me to come back and tell my people they must be good and love one another, and not fight, or steal or lie. He gave me this dance to give to my people."" #Wovoka? no source

usfp_indian_postremoval.5.f: "Horsemen and wagons crowded forth to positions on the line, readying themselves for the race. The great dramatic moment came when at the stroke of noon the starting signal was given - at the blast of rifles and cannons a tumultuous avalanche of wagons and horses surged forth amidst a cloud of dust. Families that remained behind at the line cheered for their husbands and fathers as they made their wild dash to claim their 160 acres." #adapted from The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture
usfp_indian_postremoval.5.a: "It won't be long before the whole territory is settled."
usfp_indian_postremoval.5.b: "We need to ensure there is space enough left for the tribes."

usfp_indian_postremoval.6.t: "The Underground Reservation"
usfp_indian_postremoval.6.d: "After being relocated to [SCOPE.sState('oklahoma_scope').GetName], the Osage Nation negotiated full tribal ownership over the mineral rights on their alloted land. The discovery of rich $oil$ fields under their territory has brought immense wealth to the Osage, who recieve direct dividends from the proceeds. Sensational tales of fancy clothes, luxury cars, and newly-built mansions have provoked resentment among local Whites."
usfp_indian_postremoval.6.f: ""The Osage have become the richest nation, clan, or social group of any race on Earth, including the whites, man for man. Osage county now sports more Pierce Arrows than any other county in the United States."" #Killers of the Flower Moon
usfp_indian_postremoval.6.a: "They are the chosen people of chance."
usfp_indian_postremoval.6.b: "Clearly they require White guardians to hold their wealth in trust!"

usfp_indian_postremoval.7.t: "The Reign of Terror"
usfp_indian_postremoval.7.d: "The oil wealth of the Osage Nation has brought with it a dark spectre of conspiracy. Over the past 5 years, over a hundred wealthy Osages have been found dead under suspicious circumstances, with their oil rights often being passed to White guardians. Leaders of the Osage community are certain that their people are being murdered for their wealth, and are pleading for a federal intervention."
usfp_indian_postremoval.7.f: ""It is a question in my mind whether this jury is considering a murder case or not. The question for them to decide is whether a white man killing an Osage is murder—or merely cruelty to animals."" #Killers of the Flower Moon
usfp_indian_postremoval.7.a: "Send in the Bureau, and block any more Whites from inheriting Osage rights."
usfp_indian_postremoval.7.b: "This is a local matter for the local authorities to handle."
