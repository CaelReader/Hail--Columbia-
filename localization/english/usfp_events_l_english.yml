usfp_native_removal.10.f: ""The men were handcuffed two together, and a long chain passing between the double file connected them all together. The stoical disposition of these forest philosophers was strongly displayed, for neither their physical nor mental sufferings could elicit from them the least indication of distress.

usfp_usa.7.f: ""You cannot help seeing Mr. Nast's pictures, and when you have seen them you cannot fail to understand them. When he caricatures a politician, the name of that politician ever afterwards recalls the countenance of which Mr. Nast has made him a present. An artist of this stamp — and such artists are very rare indeed — does more to affect public opinion than a score of writers.""
usfp_usa.7.a: "Let's hope he mocks our opponents!"
usfp_usa.7.b: "Cartoons are for the small-minded."

usfp_usa.8.t: "The [SCOPE.sCharacter('nast_scope').GetLastName] Effect"
usfp_usa.8.d: "The latest issue of Harper\'s Weekly includes an intricate piece by [SCOPE.sCharacter('nast_scope').GetFullName] in support of [SCOPE.sCharacter('nast_support_scope').GetFullName]\'s candidacy. The cartoon also includes a mocking depiction of [SCOPE.sCharacter('nast_target_scope').GetFullName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('nast_support_scope').GetHerHis] policies."
usfp_usa.8.f: ""Let's stop them damn pictures! I don't care so much what the papers write about — my constituents can't read — but damn it, they can see pictures!""
usfp_usa.8.a: "Good one, Nast!"
usfp_usa.8.b: "We need to discredit Harper\'s Weekly."
usfp_usa.8.c: "Stop those presses."

usfp_usa.9.t: "Constitutional Challenge"
usfp_usa.9.d: "Opponents of [SCOPE.sLaw('current_law_scope').GetName] have launched a challenge against it in the courts, attempting to have the law struck down on grounds of violating the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] Constitution. Under a strict interpretation of the Constitution, they are correct."
usfp_usa.9.f: ""The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten. Certainly all those who have framed written constitutions contemplate them as forming the fundamental and paramount law of the nation, and consequently the theory of every such government must be, that an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution, is void.""
usfp_usa.9.a: "The law cannot go forward."
usfp_usa.9.b: "Under a certain interpretation, the law is perfectly constitutional!"
usfp_usa.9.c: "Loyal judges will read the constitution as we see fit."
usfp_usa.9.d: "Damn the Constitution, this reform is for the people!"

usfp_usa.10.t: "Scientific Management"
usfp_usa.10.d: "A new theory of industrial management has risen to prominence among the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('industrialists_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('intelligentsia_scope').GetName]. This new Scientific Management seeks to determine an objectively optimal method for any given task, which is then implemented via close cooperation between managers and workers."
usfp_usa.10.f: ""The idea of training a workman under a competent teacher into new working habits until he continually and habitually works in accordance with scientific laws, is directly antagonistic to the old idea that each workman can best regulate his own way of doing the work. The philosophy of the old management puts the entire responsibility upon the workmen, while the philosophy of the new places a great part of it upon the management.""
usfp_usa.10.a: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('industrialists_scope').GetName] will ensure maximum efficiency!"
usfp_usa.10.b: "Our esteemed [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('intelligentsia_scope').GetName] will lead the cutting edge!"
usfp_usa.10.c: "The bosses already micromanage too much."
