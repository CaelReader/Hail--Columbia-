On the contrary, they were considered by the founders as a subordinate and inferior class of beings who had been subjugated by the dominant race, and, whether emancipated or not, yet remained subject to their authority, and had no rights or privileges but such as those who held the power and the Government might choose to grant them.""

usfp_manifest_destiny.1.d: "Since the days of the [concept_usfp_thirteen_colonies], the settlers of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have looked upon the lands to the west with desire, and a complete disregard for their existing inhabitants. Now a lofty justification for expansion is beginning to emerge in our national consciousness — that of Manifest Destiny. Proponents of the idea claim that it is not only our right but our sacred duty to seize and populate the entirety of the great American continent."
usfp_manifest_destiny.1.f: ""Our claim by the right of our manifest destiny is to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us. It is for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federated self-government entrusted to us.""

usfp_manifest_destiny.12.d: "As [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] settlers continue to press into the interior of [SCOPE.sState('california_scope').GetName], the state government has seen fit to embark on an official campaign of extermination against the native populace. The state has essentially pardoned all crimes commited against Indians, and is even awarding bounties for Indian scalps, begetting a wave of atrocities against the [SCOPE.sCulture('hokan_scope').GetName]."

The circular suggests purchasing the island from the [SCOPE.sCountry('cuba_owner_scope').GetAdjective] government, but also justifies taking the island by force if necessary.

usfp_manifest_destiny.14.f: ""The Union can never enjoy repose, nor possess reliable security, as long as Cuba is not embraced within its boundaries.

usfp_gilded_age.1.d: "New railroads, new industries, and new companies have roared to life across the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], precipitating a meteoric rise in the station of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('industrialists_scope').GetName]. The ever-growing fortunes of the [concept_upper_strata] have propelled them into lifestyles of lavish excess, but have also heralded an era of widespread political corruption across all levels of government."

usfp_gilded_age.2.d: "The press has broken the story of a massive corruption scheme around government railroad contracts, which has allowed a select few participants to plunder the national treasury to an obscene degree. A dozen prominent members of the [SCOPE.sParty('scandal_party').GetName] are alleged to have taken part, facilitating the fraud while taking a cut of the proceeds under the table. The opposition is demanding a comprehensive investigation and the censure of all involved."

National newspapers have already begun printing the scandal in frontpage headlines, and [concept_usfp_congress] is demanding a thorough investigation."
usfp_gilded_age.3.f: ""THE STAR ROUTE SWINDLE" was across all the papers. Caricactures of the men involved stole away bags of treasury funds while an impotent congress looked away. The mockery would have been less effective if it wasn't so accurate."

With political offices packed with cronies, purchased votes, and bribed judges, the entire apparatus of the state government is now at his beck and call. Details of Tweed's corruption and fraud have begun to leak to the press, driving public calls for his removal."
usfp_gilded_age.5.f: "The press were calling them the "Forty Thieves", the ring of Tweed's underlings who stole as much as they could from the state's budget. Inflated contracts worth five, ten, hundreds of times their true value were handed out in exchange for support. The operation wasn't particularly well hidden, but Tammany Hall controlled all the mechanisms of government, and so could simply block any complaint or inquiry."
usfp_gilded_age.5.a: "Tweed must go."

usfp_gilded_age.6.d: "Wealthy industrialist [SCOPE.sCharacter('carnegie_scope').GetFullName] has penned a controversial article asserting that the newly wealthy have a duty of philanthropy to the rest of society. According to [SCOPE.sCharacter('carnegie_scope').GetLastName], the rich should eschew extravagance and self-indulgent spending, and instead act as good shepherds of their wealth, using it to provide opportunities for the poor to uplift themselves."
usfp_gilded_age.6.f: ""This, then, is held to be the duty of the man of Wealth: First, to set an example of modest, unostentatious living; to provide moderately for the legitimate wants of those dependent upon him; and after doing so to consider all surplus revenues which come to him simply as trust funds, which he is called upon to administer, and strictly bound as a matter of duty to administer in the manner best calculated to produce the most beneficial result for the community - the man of wealth thus becoming the sole agent and trustee for his poorer brethren, bringing to their service his superior wisdom, experience, and ability to administer - doing for them better than they would or could do for themselves."" #Andrew Carnegie

usfp_gilded_age.7.d: "The introduction of the 'Washington Navel' cultivar of oranges into southern [SCOPE.sState('california_scope').GetName] has precipitated a boom in the citrus industry there.

usfp_gilded_age.8.d: "A network of farmers' advocacy groups known as The Grange has spread rapidly across the vast rural regions of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. While most chapters are focused on local legislation and establishing consumer cooperatives, the organization also serves to advance the cause of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('rural_folk_ig').GetName] nationally."
usfp_gilded_age.8.f: ""The Grange is the foe to selfishness. It is too much the habit of the farmer to regard himself and his own family only, and to be careless of the welfare or interests of others. The Grange teaches him that he is only a single member of the vast community of men who till the ground, and that this interests are identical with theirs, and that he must consider others as well as himself."" #History of the Grange Movement, James Dabney McCabe

usfp_gilded_age.9.d: "The notorious James-Younger Gang has once again staged a daring bank robbery, this time in [SCOPE.sState('minnesota_scope').GetName]. Confronted by armed locals, the gang was forced into a running gunfight and dispersed into the countryside. Officials have placed substantial bounties on the gang's leader, the legendary outlaw Jesse James, in an attempt to end the gang's activities once and for all."
usfp_gilded_age.9.f: "The cry went out - “Get your guns, boys — they’re robbing the bank!” After that all was chaos, bullets flying everywhere, men on horses firing wildly with revolvers. But soon enough the desperadoes were fleeing down the dusty road with naught but a few nickels to show for it."
usfp_gilded_age.9.a: "Let's hope that's the last of them."
usfp_gilded_age.9.b: "Jesse James belongs in prison!"

usfp_gilded_age.10.d: "Our police forces have finally apprehended Jesse James thanks to the collaboration of one of his close associates. Under heavy guard he has been escorted to jail awaiting trial for the many brazen crimes committed by him and his gang."
usfp_gilded_age.10.f: ""Eight officers on either side kept James separated from the crowd. Hundreds had turned out to see the outlaw's fate, some yelled in support and others booed. It was hard to tell whether they were booing the police or the prisoner. Most of the onlookers were just there for the spectacle, to see the final capture of the celebrity-outlaw Jesse James.""

usfp_gilded_age.11.t: "Jesse James Shot!"
usfp_gilded_age.11.d: "The celebrity outlaw Jesse James has been shot by one of his accomplices! The news of his murder has become a sensation across the country, with many hailing James as a modern Robin Hood and protector of the White Race, while others celebrate the murderer's downfall."
usfp_gilded_age.11.f: ""A great sensation was created in this city this morning by the announcement that Jesse James, the notorious bandit and train robber, had been shot and killed here. The news spread with great rapidity, but most persons received it with doubt until investigation established the fact beyond question. Then the excitement became more and more intense, and crowds of people rushed to the quarter of the city where the shooting had occurred, anxious to view the body of the dead outlaw."" #New York Tribune

All opposition has been sidelined in the courts, the legislature, and the bureaucracy, allowing corruption to run rampant."
usfp_gilded_age.12.f: ""I've been called a boss. All there is to it is having friends, doing things for people, and then later on they'll do things for you ...

usfp_gilded_age.13.t: "Railroad Boom, Railroad Bust"
usfp_gilded_age.13.d: "Land speculation and poor management of the railways in [SCOPE.sState('railway_bust_state').GetName] has lead to the collapse of several local rail companies, leaving lines empty and abandoned. Meanwhile, the railway business in [SCOPE.sState('railway_boom_state').GetName] is entering a period of sustained growth and high returns on investment."
usfp_gilded_age.13.f: "The stretch of track lie half-completed. Tools and materials were scattered around the construction site. Even several railcars sat on the track, rusting away in the sun. The company went under, and nobody was interested in buying, and so the detritus of industry is simply abandoned."
usfp_gilded_age.13.a: "Such is the natural business cycle."

usfp_gilded_age.14.t: "New Money"
usfp_gilded_age.14.d: "As modern industries expand across the country, they have created a new cohort of wealthy [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('industrialists_scope').GetName] whose fortunes exceed that of established families. Many have flocked to [SCOPE.sState('new_york_scope').GetName], building elaborate mansions and attempting to integrate themselves into high society, much to the chagrin of the Old Money aristocrats."

usfp_gilded_age.15.d: "The concentration of [SCOPE.sBuilding('company_town_building_scope').GetName] industries in [SCOPE.sState('company_town_state').GetName] has fueled the construction of whole towns owned entirely by the companies. Workers are 'encouraged' to move into housing controlled by their employer, send their kids to company schools, and even go to company-built churches."
usfp_gilded_age.15.f: "You couldn't go a single block without seeing one of the company's advertisements or its logo stamped on something. A whole group of workers was fired yesterday, and now many were packing up to move to another state. The company was the only game in town."
usfp_gilded_age.15.a: "How efficient."
usfp_gilded_age.15.b: "These companies are exerting too much influence."

### Progressive Era Events ###

usfp_progressive_era.1.t: "Rise of the Progressives"
usfp_progressive_era.1.d: "The social and economic conditions of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have prompted calls for reform from all levels of society, which have now begun to coalesce into a greater [SCOPE.sIdeology('progressive_ideology').GetName] cause. Local, state, and even federal officials are now winning elections on a platform of ending corruption and uplifting the general welfare."
usfp_progressive_era.1.f: ""Our great industrial organizations are in control of politics, government and national resources. They manage conventions, make platforms, dictate legislation. They rule through the very men elected to represent the people. The battle is just on. It is young yet. It will be the longest and hardest ever fought for Democracy.

usfp_progressive_era.2.d: "A new theory of industrial management has risen to prominence among the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('industrialists_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('intelligentsia_scope').GetName]. This new study of Scientific Management seeks to determine an objectively optimal method for any given task, which is then implemented via close managerial oversight of workers."
usfp_progressive_era.2.f: ""The idea of training a workman under a competent teacher into new working habits until he continually and habitually works in accordance with scientific laws, is directly antagonistic to the old idea that each workman can best regulate his own way of doing the work. The philosophy of the old management puts the entire responsibility upon the workmen, while the philosophy of the new places a great part of it upon the management.""

usfp_progressive_era.3.t: "The American Anti-Imperialist League"
usfp_progressive_era.3.d: "A political organization called the Anti-Imperialist League has been founded to oppose [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] military expansionism. While small in number, many prominent writers and politicans have lent their support to the organization, calling for restraint in our foreign policy."
usfp_progressive_era.3.f: ""These policies will furnish an excuse, and to many a justifying reason for the creation and maintenance of vast navies and mighty armies, through the lifetime of the nation, whether called a republic or empire. Despotism — absolutism in government — is the necessity of the army and the navy, and in such schools and from such training can we expect to create or even to preserve ideas and practices that are consistent with republican institutions?"" #George S Boutwell
usfp_progressive_era.3.a: "We must preserve peace to preserve the republic."

usfp_progressive_era.4.t: "World Parliament of Religions"
usfp_progressive_era.4.d: "A novel interfaith gathering held in [SCOPE.sState('illinois_scope').GetCityHubName] has brought together a wide array of religious leaders, many representing foreign faiths unfamiliar to the average [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]. Hindu monk [SCOPE.sCharacter('vivekananda_scope').GetFullName] gave an inspired speech promoting universal brotherhood between all religions, causing him to become an instant celebrity and prompting invitations for him to lecture across the country."
usfp_progressive_era.4.f: ""I will quote to you brethren a few lines from a hymn which I remember to have repeated from my earliest childhood, which is every day repeated by millions of human beings: As the different streams having their sources in different places all mingle their water in the sea, so, O Lord, the different paths which men take through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee."" #Swami Vivekananda

usfp_progressive_era.5.t: "Popular Eugenics"
usfp_progressive_era.5.d: "A peculiar solution to our social problems has emerged among some [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] intellectuals and professionals - that of Eugenics, the selective breeding of humans. Proponents claim that the underlying source of crime and deliquency is poor family planning, and that the obvious solution is to limit the reproduction of so-called 'defective' members of society."
usfp_progressive_era.5.f: ""The more severely burdened should not propagate themselves. If we do nothing but make mental and physical cripples capable of propagating themselves, and the healthy stocks have to limit the number of their children because so much has to be done for the maintenance of others, if natural selection is generally suppressed, then unless we will get new measures our race must rapidly deteriorate."" #Eugen Bleuler, textbook of Psychiatry

usfp_progressive_era.6.t: "City Beautiful"
usfp_progressive_era.6.d: "The new generation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] architects and urban planners have embraced a philosophy they call 'City Beautiful', that seeks to uplift our cities through grand projects of monumental architecture and open green spaces. Not only will these new designs beautify our [SCOPE.sBuilding('urban_center_scope').GetName]s, but will also apparently promote civic virtue and a higher quality of life. A grand plan to renovate [SCOPE.sState('dc_scope').GetCityHubName] in this mold has been proposed, to serve as a template for the rest of the country."
usfp_progressive_era.6.f: "The plan was to recreate Washington into the grand monumental capital that it was always meant to be. A grand open mall lined with elm trees would serve as the new core of the city, flanked by government buildings and museums. At the center of it all, the Washington Monument would stand tall, a proud symbol for a proud capital."
usfp_progressive_era.6.a: "Some remodeling would certainly be appreciated."
usfp_progressive_era.6.b: "This all sounds rather wasteful."

usfp_progressive_era.7.t: "Social Hygiene"
usfp_progressive_era.7.d: "Prostitution and venereal disease have long been a reality of urban life in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], issues often ignored and hushed up by 'polite' society. A new 'Social Hygiene' reform movement seeks to remedy these ills by outlawing prostitution entirely and educating young people on proper moral behavior, while also publicizing new scientific understandings of sexual health and disease."
usfp_progressive_era.7.f: ""If we saw a venomous snake slipping unawares upon its unsuspecting victim, would we fail to give the warning because we preferred the victim should not know of the existence of the reptile? No! But we allow innocent girls to pay the penalty of ignorance, by their lives, because false modestry says they should not know anything about venereal diseases, and the their very names must be spoken in hushed tones."" #False Modesty, EB Lowry

usfp_progressive_era.8.d: "Middle class women across the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] have begun to embrace the cause of [SCOPE.sLaw('womens_suffrage_law').GetName], forming clubs and social groups advocating for their rights. Activists like [SCOPE.sCharacter('jane_addams_scope').GetFullName] promote women's rights as an extension of a woman's household duties, caring not just for their families but also for their entire communities."
usfp_progressive_era.8.f: ""It is annoying to have to stop in the midst of our social work and realize that we cannot pass important measure till we obtain a vote, and that we must start parades and hold meetings and maybe throw things before we get it. When people realize that the highest interests of the nation cannot be secured and preserved except by the cooperation of men and women in government, I think we shall be surprised by the quick way in which the franchise will come to our hands."" #Jane Addams

usfp_progressive_era.9.d: "In an effort to extend democratic power directly to its citizens, the government of [SCOPE.sState('initiative_state_scope').GetName] has adopted a system of direct ballot initiatives. Policies with widespread local support can now bypass the political parties and machines, acting as a check against entrenched interests."

A shocking [Concept('concept_usfp_muckrakers', '$concept_usfp_muckraker$')] exposé has revealed that not only do many of these drugs not deliver health, they in fact lead to harm, addiction, and death! An outraged public has already begun pressing for new regulations to be placed on medicines to ensure their quality and efficacy."
usfp_progressive_era.10.f: ""Gullible America will spend this year some seventy-five millions of dollars in the purchase of patent medicines. In consideration of this sum it will swallow huge quantities of alcohol, an appalling amount of opiates and narcotics, a wide assortment of varied drugs ranging from powerful and dangerous heart depressants to insidious liver stimulants; and, far in excess of all other ingredients, undiluted fraud.

usfp_progressive_era.11.f: ""The great packing machine ground on remorselessly, without thinking of green fields; and the men and women and children who were part of it never saw any green thing, not even a flower. Four or five miles to the east of them lay the blue waters of Lake Michigan; but for all the good it did them it might have been as far away as the Pacific Ocean.

The train is slowed to a rate of speed about equal to that of the herd; the passengers get out fire-arms which are provided for the defense of the train against the Indians, and open from the windows and platforms of the cars a fire that resembles a brisk skirmish. Frequently a young bull will turn at bay for a moment.
