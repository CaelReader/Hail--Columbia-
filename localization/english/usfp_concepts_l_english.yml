concept_usfp_nullification_crisis: "Nullification Crisis"
concept_usfp_nullification_crisis_desc: "The nullification crisis was a sectional political crisis in the United States which pit the state government of South Carolina against the federal government. It ensued after South Carolina declared the federal Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 unconstitutional and therefore null and void within the sovereign boundaries of the state. In Washington, an open split on the issue occurred between President Jackson and Vice President John C. Calhoun, a native South Carolinian and the most effective proponent of the constitutional theory of state nullification.\n\nSouth Carolina initiated military preparations to resist anticipated federal enforcement of the tariffs, but in March of 1833, Congress passed both the Force Bill — authorizing the president to use military forces against South Carolina — and a new negotiated tariff which was satisfactory to South Carolina. The South Carolina convention reconvened and repealed its Nullification Ordinance, but three days later, nullified the Force Bill as a symbolic gesture of principle.\n\nThe crisis was over, and both sides found reasons to claim victory. The tariff rates were reduced and stayed low to the satisfaction of the South, but the states' rights doctrine of nullification remained controversial, and would become more and more relevant as slavery became the dominant issue in American politics." #credit to Wikipedia
