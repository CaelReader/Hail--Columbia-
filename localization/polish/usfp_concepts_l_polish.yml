 concept_usfp_nullification_crisis: "Nullification Crisis"
 concept_usfp_nullification_crisis_desc: "The nullification crisis was a sectional political crisis in the United States which pit the state government of South Carolina against the federal government. It ensued after South Carolina declared the federal Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 unconstitutional and therefore null and void within the sovereign boundaries of the state. In Washington, an open split on the issue occurred between President Jackson and Vice President John C. Calhoun, a native South Carolinian and the most effective proponent of the constitutional theory of state nullification.\n\nSouth Carolina initiated military preparations to resist anticipated federal enforcement of the tariffs, but in March of 1833, Congress passed both the Force Bill — authorizing the president to use military forces against South Carolina — and a new negotiated tariff which was satisfactory to South Carolina. The South Carolina convention reconvened and repealed its Nullification Ordinance, but three days later, nullified the Force Bill as a symbolic gesture of principle.\n\nThe crisis was over, and both sides found reasons to claim victory. The tariff rates were reduced and stayed low to the satisfaction of the South, but the states' rights doctrine of nullification remained controversial, and would become more and more relevant as slavery became the dominant issue in American politics."
  
 concept_usfp_louisiana_purchase: "Louisiana Purchase"
 concept_usfp_louisiana_purchase_desc: "The Louisiana Purchase was the acquisition of the territory of Louisiana by the United States from the French First Republic in 1803. This consisted of most of the land in the Mississippi River's drainage basin west of the river. In return for fifteen million dollars, or approximately eighteen dollars per square mile, the United States nominally acquired a total territory of 828,000 sq mi which would later become the central United States. On paper, the size of the United States roughly doubled.\n\nIn reality, France only controlled a small fraction of this area, most of which was inhabited by Native Americans. Effectively, for the majority of the area, the United States bought the preemptive right to obtain Indian lands by treaty or by conquest, to the exclusion of the other colonial powers. The struggle for real control over the territory would persist well into the 1900s."

 concept_usfp_trusts: "Trusts"
 concept_usfp_trusts_desc: "A trust is a large grouping of business interests with significant market power, which may be embodied as a corporation or as a group of corporations that cooperate with one another in various ways. Although such corporate trusts were initially set up to improve the organization of large businesses, they soon faced widespread accusations of abusing their market power to engage in anticompetitive business practices in order to establish and maintain monopolies. Such accusations caused the term trust to become strongly associated with such practices among the American public and led to the enactment in 1890 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the first U.S. federal competition statute.\n\n Prominent historical trusts included Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, and the American Tobacco Company."

 concept_usfp_political_machines: "Political Machines"
 concept_usfp_political_machine: "Political Machine"
 concept_usfp_political_machines_desc: "A political machine is a party organization that recruits its members by the use of tangible incentives, such as money or political jobs, and that is characterized by a high degree of leadership control over member activity. While these elements are common to most political parties and organizations, they are essential to political machines, which rely on hierarchy and rewards for political power, often enforced by a strong party whip structure. Machines sometimes have a political boss, typically rely on patronage, the spoils system, "behind-the-scenes" control, and longstanding political ties within the structure of a representative democracy.\n\nMachines take control of local politics through a hierarchical system headed by a "boss" who held the allegiance of local business leaders, elected officials and their appointees, and who knew the proverbial buttons to push to get things done. This system of political control emerged particularly in the Gilded Age. A single powerful figure (the boss) was at the center and was bound together to a complex organization of lesser figures (the political machine) by reciprocity in promoting financial and social self-interest.\n\nOne of the most infamous of these political machines was Tammany Hall, the Democratic Party machine that played a major role in controlling New York City and New York politics and helping immigrants, most notably the Irish, rise up in American politics from the 1790s to the 1960s. From 1872, Tammany had an Irish "boss". However, Tammany Hall also served as an engine for graft and political corruption, perhaps most notoriously under William M. "Boss" Tweed in the mid-19th century."

 concept_usfp_muckrakers: "Muckrakers"
 concept_usfp_muckraker: "Muckraker"
 concept_usfp_muckrakers_desc: "The muckrakers were a cohort of reform-minded journalists, writers, and photographers in the Progressive Era who claimed to expose corruption and wrongdoing in established institutions, often through sensationalist publications. Muckraking magazines — notably McClure's of the publisher S. S. McClure — took on corporate monopolies and [concept_usfp_political_machines], while trying to raise public awareness and anger at urban poverty, unsafe working conditions, prostitution, and child labor. Most of the muckrakers wrote nonfiction, but fictional exposés often had a major impact, too, such as those by Upton Sinclair.\n\nIn contrast with objective reporting, the muckrakers saw themselves primarily as reformers and were politically engaged. While the muckrakers continued the investigative exposures and sensational traditions of the older 'yellow' journalism style, they wrote to change society. Their work reached a mass audience as circulation figures of the magazines rose on account of visibility and public interest.\n\nProminent historical muckrakers include Ida M. Tarbell, Upton Sinclair, and Lincoln Steffens."

 concept_usfp_popular_sovereignty: "Popular Sovereignty"
 concept_usfp_popular_sovereignty_desc: "In the 1850s, in the run-up to the Civil War, Northern Democrats led by Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan and Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois promoted popular sovereignty as a middle position on the slavery issue. It said that actual residents of territories should be able to decide by voting whether or not slavery would be allowed in the territory. The federal government did not have to make the decision, and by appealing to democracy, Cass and Douglas hoped they could finesse the question of support for or opposition to slavery. Douglas applied popular sovereignty to Kansas in the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which passed Congress in 1854.\n\nThe Act had two unexpected results. By dropping the Missouri Compromise of 1820 under which said slavery would never be allowed in Kansas, it was a major boost for the expansion of slavery. Overnight, outrage united anti-slavery forces across the North into an "anti-Nebraska" movement that soon was institutionalized as the Republican Party, with its firm commitment to stop the expansion of slavery."

 concept_usfp_supreme_court: "Supreme Court"
 concept_usfp_supreme_court_desc: "The Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) is the highest court in the federal judiciary of the United States. It has ultimate jurisdiction over all U.S. federal court cases, and over state court cases that turn on questions of U.S. constitutional or federal law. In 1803, the Court asserted itself the power of judicial review, the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the Constitution. It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law.\n\nJustices have lifetime tenure, meaning they remain on the court until they die, retire, resign, or are impeached and removed from office. When a vacancy occurs, the president, with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoints a new justice, allowing Presidential administrations a considerable degree of influence on future rulings."

 concept_usfp_jim_crow: "Jim Crow"
 concept_usfp_jim_crow_desc: "The Jim Crow laws were state and local laws introduced in the Southern United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that enforced racial segregation, "Jim Crow" being a pejorative term for an African American. In practice, Jim Crow laws mandated racial segregation in all public facilities in the states of the former Confederate States of America and in some others, beginning in the 1870s.\n\nAlthough theoretically "seperate but equal", facilities for African Americans were consistently inferior and underfunded compared to facilities for white Americans; sometimes, there were no facilities for the black community at all. Far from equality, as a body of law, Jim Crow institutionalized economic, educational, political and social disadvantages and second-class citizenship for most African Americans living in the United States."

 concept_usfp_thirteen_colonies: "Thirteen Colonies"
 concept_usfp_thirteen_colonies_desc: "The Thirteen Colonies refers to the group of British colonies on the Atlantic coast of North America which broke away from the British Crown in the American Revolutionary War, and joined to form the United States of America.\n\nThe thirteen colonies had a degree of self-governance and active local elections, and they resisted London's demands for more control over them. The French and Indian War against France and its Indian allies led to growing tensions between Britain and the thirteen colonies. During the 1750s, the colonies began collaborating with one another instead of dealing directly with Britain. With the help of colonial printers and newspapers, these inter-colonial activities and concerns were shared and led to calls for protection of the colonists' "Rights as Englishmen", especially the principle of "no taxation without representation".\n\nLate 18th century conflicts with the British government over taxes and rights led to the American Revolution, in which the Thirteen Colonies joined for the first time to form the Continental Congress and raised the Continental Army, declaring independence in 1776."

 concept_usfp_monroe_doctrine: "Monroe Doctrine"
 concept_usfp_monroe_doctrine_desc: "The Monroe Doctrine is a United States foreign policy position that opposes European colonialism in the Western Hemisphere. It holds that any intervention in the political affairs of the Americas by foreign powers is a potentially hostile act against the United States. President James Monroe first articulated the doctrine during his seventh annual State of the Union Address to Congress.\n\nAt the time, nearly all Spanish colonies in the Americas had either achieved or were close to independence. Monroe asserted that the New World and the Old World were to remain distinctly separate spheres of influence, and thus further efforts by European powers to control or influence sovereign states in the region would be viewed as a threat to U.S. security. In turn, the United States would recognize and not interfere with existing European colonies nor meddle in the internal affairs of European countries.\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine will be violated if a [concept_country] from outside the Americas targets a [concept_country] in the Americas (other than the United States) with a [concept_diplomatic_play], unless the target is already a subject of the initiator."
